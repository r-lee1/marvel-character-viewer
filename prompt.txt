Using Marvel’s API,
Create a character viewer in react.
Please have (at least) the character photo, character name, and character description on the character cards.
Pagination is a plus, infinite loading is a huge plus.
Please also set up your code in a way that is easy for other developers to read and maintain.
Additional styling will also be a plus, including hover states.Any additional features will be considered a plus if implemented well.

Treat this as an app you’ll continue to use and build upon, and all of the implications that go along with that.
